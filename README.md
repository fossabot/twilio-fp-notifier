# twilio fastpass+ notifier

made this to scratch my own itch cause I'm trying to get flight of passage fastpasses for my trip in september.

copy sample.env to .env and modify as needed.

make sure the ride name matches the one listed on touringplans.com. check here: https://touringplans.com/animal-kingdom/fastpass-availability/date/2017-09-11

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 search.py```
